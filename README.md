# 🚀 End-to-End Machine Learning Project — Customer Personality Segmentation

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Customer Personality Segmentation is an end-to-end Machine Learning project designed to analyze customer data and predict customer personality segments using ML algorithms.

The system helps malls, retail stores, and product-based companies understand customer behavior by grouping customers into clusters based on personal details and purchasing history.

This project implements a complete production-level ML pipeline including data ingestion, validation, transformation, clustering, model training, and deployment using Flask and Render.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Businesses collect large amounts of customer data, but extracting actionable insights from it can be difficult.

The goal of this project is to:

* Cluster customers based on behavioral and demographic data.
* Identify customer personality segments.
* Predict the cluster number of new customers dynamically using machine learning classification techniques.

This enables:

* Targeted marketing strategies
* Personalized recommendations
* Improved business decision-making

## 💡 Proposed Solution

The solution uses a Machine Learning approach where:

1. Historical customer data is processed and validated.
2. Customers are grouped into clusters using unsupervised learning.
3. A classification model learns from clustered data.
4. The system predicts the cluster type for new customers based on input features.
