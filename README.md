## 📌 Project Overview

Customer Personality Segmentation is an end-to-end Machine Learning project designed to analyze customer data and predict customer personality segments using machine learning algorithms.

The system helps malls, retail stores, and product-based companies understand customer behavior by grouping customers into meaningful clusters based on personal details and purchasing history.

This project demonstrates a complete production-level ML pipeline including:

* Data ingestion
* Data transformation
* Customer clustering
* Model training
* Prediction pipeline
* Flask web application
* Deployment using Render

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Businesses collect large amounts of customer data, but extracting actionable insights from it can be challenging.

The objectives of this project are:

* Cluster customers based on behavioral and demographic data.
* Identify customer personality segments.
* Predict cluster numbers dynamically for new customers using classification techniques.

This enables:

* Targeted marketing strategies
* Personalized product recommendations
* Improved business decision-making

## 💡 Proposed Solution

The solution follows a machine learning pipeline:

1. Historical customer data is ingested and validated.
2. Customers are grouped using clustering algorithms.
3. Cluster labels are used to train a classification model.
4. New customer inputs are processed through the prediction pipeline to determine cluster type.
